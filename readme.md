# Gastrointestinal Condition Classification System

## Introduction

Identifying gastrointestinal conditions from medical images is crucial for accurate diagnosis and treatment planning. However, distinguishing between various conditions such as **Diverticulosis**, **Neoplasm**, **Peritonitis**, and **Ureters** can be challenging without automated classification systems. 

This project aims to develop a multiclass classification system capable of accurately identifying different gastrointestinal conditions from medical images. 

## Objectives

- Develop a multiclass classification model to classify various gastrointestinal conditions.
- Train the system on a diverse dataset covering a wide range of conditions, including:
  - Diverticulosis
  - Neoplasm
  - Peritonitis
  - Ureters
- Improve the efficiency and accuracy of diagnosing gastrointestinal conditions to benefit both patients and healthcare providers.

## Problem Statement

Manual analysis of each medical image is time-consuming and prone to human error. Developing separate binary classification models for each condition may not efficiently utilize the available data and could lead to suboptimal performance. 

## Proposed Solution

The proposed system will leverage machine learning techniques to automate the classification of gastrointestinal conditions. By training a single multiclass classification model, the system aims to improve diagnostic accuracy and efficiency.

## Dataset

- A diverse dataset consisting of medical images representing various gastrointestinal conditions.
- The dataset should be labeled with the corresponding condition for supervised learning.

## Methodology

1. **Data Collection**: Gather a comprehensive dataset of medical images for each condition. Save the dataset in the drive for better working of the model(In my code I have used my drive eg. # train_dir = '/content/drive/MyDrive/Medicaldataset/Medical_Imaging/Medical-imaging-train', # test_dir = '/content/drive/MyDrive/Medicaldataset/Medical_Imaging/Medical-imaging-test')

2. Take the reference of the dataset from this website: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/axios-machine-learning-wing-equinox/data


3. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the dataset for training, including resizing images, normalization, and augmentation.
4. **Model Development**: 
   - Choose a suitable architecture for the classification model (e.g., CNN, Transfer Learning).
   - Train the model on the prepared dataset.
5. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall).
6. **Deployment**: Deploy the model for practical use in diagnosing gastrointestinal conditions.

## Benefits

- Increased efficiency in diagnosing gastrointestinal conditions.
- Reduced risk of human error in image analysis.
- Improved treatment planning based on accurate classification.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Libraries: TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, etc.
- Access to a suitable GPU for training (recommended).
